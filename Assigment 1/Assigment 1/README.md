# README

Put useful *info* here about how **to run the build**, develop locally, and any other relevant info. [link name](https://google.com)

## Pages (required)

- [ ] Search form
- [ ] Sample results Page
- [ ] Sample individual object page
- [ ] Object submission Page
- [ ] User Registration page

*note: we also need to implement a **header**, **footer**, and **navigation menu** (optionally a **sidebar** as well)*

## Pages (nice to have)

- [ ] Home Page
- [ ] Login Page

## other

We should really try to host our webpage, if possible.

## problems

On pages that use flexbox the line from the footer will be above the main body even though its not in the code. Use html validator to check for problems.
