## Things We Did To Go Above And Beyond

IMPORTANT: FOR OUR PROJECT WE DID NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS ie. BootStrap...etc. OR ANY LIBRARIES. EVERYTHING WAS HARD CODED FROM SCRATCH!!!

## Solved Problems

On pages that use flexbox the line from the footer will be above the main body even though its not in the code. Use html validator to check for problems. This problem was solved by changing the flex-columns attribute to be a class instead of an id.

## Current Issues

Ok so the fix I made to flexbox in solved problems to make the code verify in https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload works perfectly for Chrome, Firefox and Safari but it makes the flexbox grid look wrong in microsoft edge.

When you press submit on the registration page and it gives you an incorrect file type for the image submission and then you choose
a correct file type for the image and the rest of the fields are also correct the page will not submit until it is refreshed.
