## Things We Did To Go Above And Beyond

IMPORTANT: FOR OUR PROJECT WE DID NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS ie. BootStrap...etc. OR ANY LIBRARIES. EVERYTHING WAS HARD CODED FROM SCRATCH!!!

## Solved Problems

On pages that use flexbox the line from the footer will be above the main body even though its not in the code. Use html validator to check for problems. This problem was solved by changing the flex-columns attribute to be a class instead of an id.

## Current Issues

None at the moment
